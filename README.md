## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and data analysis workflow using real-world healthcare datasets. The project consists of two main components:

1. **Healthcare Data Cleaning & ETL**: Cleaning and validation of corrupted notifiable disease datasets from Nova Scotia's Open Data Portal
2. **COVID-19 Data Analysis**: Advanced analysis of global COVID-19 data including dimensionality reduction, distribution fitting, and correlation analysis

The project showcases essential data engineering and analysis skills including data validation, missing value imputation, consistency checking, dimensionality reduction, and statistical analysis.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning Pipeline**:
  - Duplicate detection and removal
  - Missing value imputation
  - Range error correction
  - Cross-dataset consistency validation
  - Automated data quality checks
  
- **Advanced Analysis**:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
  - Distribution fitting using Fitter library
  - Entropy calculation for disease distribution
  - Correlation analysis of key health metrics
  
- **Visualization**:
  - Interactive disease trend visualizations
  - PCA component analysis
  - Distribution comparison plots

## Datasets
